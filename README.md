## Description

Note: This Game is still in it's white boxing prototype phase; therefore a lot of code optimization is still not implemented to prevent the potential of painting myself into a corner. "Premature optimisation is the root of all evil". 

This genre-switching game offers a unique and engaging gaming experience by combining elements of first-person shooter (FPS), platformer, topdown, and other game genres. The project was motivated by the desire to create a diverse gaming experience that challenges players and offers variety in gameplay. It includes a rich main menu, a loadout system, weapon and ammo purchasing, and interactive music using FMOD.

- Platformer controller upgrade ->  use coyote timer; jump holding ; fall gravity scale; 2D physics material on player
- Refactor the runtime loading code to use Addressables API instead of Resources API.
- SOLID when rapid prototype phase is over
- Divide levels up into several scenes with Loadsceneasync
- Weapon stats display 
- Improve error handling
