## Description

Note: This Game is still in it's white boxing prototype phase; therefore a lot of code optimization is still not implemented to prevent the potential of painting myself into a corner. "Premature optimisation is the root of all evil". 

This genre-switching game offers a unique and engaging gaming experience by combining elements of first-person shooter (FPS), platformer, topdown, and other game genres. The project was motivated by the desire to create a diverse gaming experience that challenges players and offers variety in gameplay. It includes a rich main menu, a loadout system, weapon and ammo purchasing, and interactive music using FMOD.

- Weapon stats display 
- Improve error handling
- Implement support for different projectile types, such as homing projectiles or projectiles that bounce off surfaces.
- Add support for weapon attachments, like scopes, silencers, or extended magazines, which would modify weapon behavior and visuals.
